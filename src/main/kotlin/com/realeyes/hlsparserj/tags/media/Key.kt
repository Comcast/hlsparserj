/**
 * <pre>
 * Represents the EXT-X-KEY tag.
 *
 * Media segments MAY be encrypted.  The EXT-X-KEY tag specifies how to
 * decrypt them.  It applies to every media segment that appears between
 * it and the next EXT-X-KEY tag in the Playlist file with the same
 * KEYFORMAT attribute (or the end of the Playlist file).  Two or more
 * EXT-X-KEY tags with different KEYFORMAT attributes MAY apply to the
 * same media segment, in which case they MUST resolve to the same key.
 * Its format is:
 *
 * #EXT-X-KEY:&lt;attribute-list&gt;
 *
 * The following attributes are defined:
 *
 * METHOD
 *
 * The value is an enumerated-string that specifies the encryption
 * method.  This attribute is REQUIRED.
 *
 * The methods defined are: NONE, AES-128, and SAMPLE-AES.
 *
 * An encryption method of NONE means that media segments are not
 * encrypted.  If the encryption method is NONE, the following
 * attributes MUST NOT be present: URI; IV; KEYFORMAT;
 * KEYFORMATVERSIONS.
 *
 * An encryption method of AES-128 means that media segments are
 * completely encrypted using the Advanced Encryption Standard [AES_128]
 * with a 128-bit key and PKCS7 padding [RFC5652].  If the encryption
 * method is AES-128, the URI attribute MUST be present.  The IV
 * attribute MAY be present; see Section 5.2.
 *
 * An encryption method of SAMPLE-AES means that the media segments
 * contain elementary streams of audio, video, or other samples that are
 * encrypted using the Advanced Encryption Standard [AES_128].  How an
 * elementary stream is encrypted depends on the media encoding.  The
 * encryption format for H.264 [H_264], AAC [ISO_14496] and AC-3 [AC_3]
 * elementary streams is described by [SampleEnc].  The IV attribute MAY
 * be present; see Section 5.2.
 *
 * A client MUST NOT not attempt to decrypt any segments whose EXT-X-KEY
 * tag has a METHOD attribute that it does not recognize.
 *
 * URI
 *
 * The value is a quoted-string containing a URI [RFC3986] that
 * specifies how to obtain the key.  This attribute is REQUIRED unless
 * the METHOD is NONE.
 *
 * IV
 *
 * The value is a hexadecimal-integer that specifies the Initialization
 * Vector to be used with the key.  The IV attribute appeared in
 * protocol version 2.  See Section 5.2 for when the IV attribute is
 * used.
 *
 * KEYFORMAT
 *
 * The value is a quoted-string that specifies how the key is
 * represented in the resource identified by the URI; see Section 5 for
 * more detail.  This attribute is OPTIONAL; its absence indicates, an
 * implicit value of "identity".  The KEYFORMAT attribute appeared in
 * protocol version 5.
 *
 * KEYFORMATVERSIONS
 *
 * The value is a quoted-string containing one or more positive integers
 * separated by the "/" character (for example, "1/3").  If more than
 * one version of a particular KEYFORMAT is defined, this attribute can
 * be used to indicate which version(s) this instance complies with.
 * This attribute is OPTIONAL; if it is not present, its value is
 * considered to be "1".  The KEYFORMATVERSIONS attribute appeared in
 * protocol version 5.
 *
 * If the Media Playlist file does not contain an EXT-X-KEY tag then
 * media segments are not encrypted.
 *
 * See Section 5 for the format of the key file, and Section 5.2,
 * Section 6.2.3 and Section 6.3.6 for additional information on media
 * segment encryption.
