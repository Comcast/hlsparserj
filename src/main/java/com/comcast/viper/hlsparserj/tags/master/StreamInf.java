/**
 * <pre>
 * Represents a variant stream tag.
 *
 * The EXT-X-STREAM-INF tag specifies a variant stream, which is a set
 * of renditions which can be combined to play the presentation.  The
 *  attributes of the tag provide information about the variant stream.
 *
 * The EXT-X-STREAM-INF tag identifies the next URI line in the Playlist
 * as a rendition of the variant stream.
 *
 * The EXT-X-STREAM-INF tag MUST NOT appear in a Media Playlist.
 *
 * Its format is:
 *
 *   #EXT-X-STREAM-INF:&lt;attribute-list&gt;
 *   &lt;URI&gt;
 *
 * The following attributes are defined:
 *
 * BANDWIDTH
 *
 * The value is a decimal-integer of bits per second.  It MUST be an
 * upper bound of the overall bitrate of each media segment (calculated
 * to include container overhead) that appears or will appear in the
 * Playlist.
 *
 * Every EXT-X-STREAM-INF tag MUST include the BANDWIDTH attribute.
 *
 * CODECS
 *
 * The value is a quoted-string containing a comma-separated list of
 * formats, where each format specifies a media sample type that is
 * present in a media segment in the Media Playlist file.  Valid format
 * identifiers are those in the ISO Base Media File Format Name Space
 * defined by RFC 6381 [RFC6381].
 *
 * Every EXT-X-STREAM-INF tag SHOULD include a CODECS attribute.
 *
 * RESOLUTION
 *
 * The value is a decimal-resolution describing the approximate encoded
 * horizontal and vertical resolution of video within the presentation.
 *
 * The RESOLUTION attribute is OPTIONAL but is recommended if the
 * variant stream includes video.
 *
 * AUDIO
 *
 * The value is a quoted-string.  It MUST match the value of the
 * GROUP-ID attribute of an EXT-X-MEDIA tag elsewhere in the Master
 * Playlist whose TYPE attribute is AUDIO.  It indicates the set of
 * audio renditions that MAY be used when playing the presentation.  See
 * Section 3.4.10.1.
 *
 * The AUDIO attribute is OPTIONAL.
 *
 * VIDEO
 *
 * The value is a quoted-string.  It MUST match the value of the
 * GROUP-ID attribute of an EXT-X-MEDIA tag elsewhere in the Master
 * Playlist whose TYPE attribute is VIDEO.  It indicates the set of
 * video renditions that MAY be used when playing the presentation.  See
 * Section 3.4.10.1.
 *
 * The VIDEO attribute is OPTIONAL.
 *
 * SUBTITLES
 *
 * The value is a quoted-string.  It MUST match the value of the
 * GROUP-ID attribute of an EXT-X-MEDIA tag elsewhere in the Master
 * Playlist whose TYPE attribute is SUBTITLES.  It indicates the set of
 * subtitle renditions that MAY be used when playing the presentation.
 * See Section 3.4.10.1.
 *
 * The SUBTITLES attribute is OPTIONAL.
 *
 * CLOSED-CAPTIONS
 *
 * The value can be either a quoted-string or an enumerated-string with
 * the value NONE.  If the value is a quoted-string, it MUST match the
 * value of the GROUP-ID attribute of an EXT-X-MEDIA tag elsewhere in
 * the Playlist whose TYPE attribute is CLOSED-CAPTIONS, and indicates
 * the set of closed-caption renditions that may be used when playlist
 * the presentation.  See Section 3.4.10.1.
 *
 * If the value is the enumerated-string value NONE, all EXT-X-STREAM-
 * INF tags MUST have this attribute with a value of NONE.  This
 * indicates that there are no closed captions in any variant stream in
 * the Master Playlist.
 *
 * The CLOSED-CAPTIONS attribute is OPTIONAL.
